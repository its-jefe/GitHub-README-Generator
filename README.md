***
## Usage

answer them in as much detail as possible and voila! 

A readme file is generated in the distribution folder.

## Future 

- I would like to break down the intsallation, usage, and contributing prompts into steps.

- Add a form for uploading photos and test files. (Testing form-data package)

- Likely will add more badges.
