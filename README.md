# GitHub README Generator
## Description
Starter code from [How to create a Professional README](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md) by [Xandromus](https://github.com/Xandromus). 

This node.js application began using only the inquirer package as a means to prompt the user for information on their projects to generate a README. It has become an even greater vessel for learning and now implements multiple node packages and the github API.

* inquirer: command line user-prompts
* node-fetch: allow fetch for github api
* form-data: allows image upload

## Installation

1. Download the code from the GitHub and unzip.

2. Make sure you are in the project directory then install dependencies with "npm install".

3. Now you are ready to move onto Usage! 
***
## Usage

1. Run "node index.js" to begin using the application.

2. You will be taken through a series of prompts...
answer them in as much detail as possible and voila! 

A readme file is generated in the distribution folder. 
***
## Future 

- I would like to break down the intsallation, usage, and contributing prompts into steps.

- Would also like to add a form of user uploading for photos and test files.
    - Testing form-data package

- Likely will add more badges.
