# GitHub README Generator

## Description
Loosely based on [How to create a Professional README](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma/blob/main/readme-guide.md) from [Xandromus](https://github.com/Xandromus)

This node.js application began requiring only the inquirer package as a means to prompt the user for information on their projects. It has become a vessel for learning and I have implemented multiple node packages and the github API. 
    
    inquirer: command line user-prompts
    node-fetch: allow fetch for github api
    form-data: allows image upload
